- 👋 Hi, I’m @silvadriana
- 👀 I’m interested in helping people finding their careers and not only a job!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Project Management through the Google Academy on Coursera.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever: I'm always up to new challenges and to roam the unknown.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm sure you'll find a way to reach me :)
